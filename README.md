# hardwarelab
hardware lab for advanced robotics at the University of Edinburgh

To get started, simply clone the repository to you local DICE machine:

```git clone --recursive https://github.com/ediadvancedrobotics/hardwarelab.git```

install the requirements using 

```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```


and open the html file corresponding to the lab number. The first lab only deals with the motors,
we will add the arms of our robot from the second lab.

## Important notes
Due to last minute changes to fix recent issues with the hardware, you will most likely have to update the repository each week prior
to running the lab.
