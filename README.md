# hardwarelab
hardware lab for advanced robotics at the University of Edinburgh

To get started, simply clone the repository to you local DICE machine:

```git clone --recursive https://github.com/ediadvancedrobotics/hardwarelab.git```

and open the notebook corresponding to the lab number. The first lab only deals with the motors,
we will add the arms of our robot from the second lab.
