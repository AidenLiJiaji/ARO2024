    "# Hardware lab 1 (and 2): implementing your control law / Steer by wire\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first hardware lab we are first going to work without the passive arms of our robot and only focus on the motors. The objective of the lab is to informally play with the motor API and understand the possible issues that can  arise when trying to control accurately a motor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, we will play with the notion of PD control (discussed in next week's lecture) and use this to reproduce a [steer-by-wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steer-by-wire) system. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "First, listen to Garry or Katy for the first few minutes of the lab while they provide some guidance on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communicating with the device\n",
    "The DICE machines are connected to the platform using a CAN device. This is hidden within a high-level API but you can have a look at the code if you are interested in seeing how all of this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work, open a python console, or edit a file and execute the code that follows. The CAN bus protocol does not work very with Jupyter notebooks unfortunately and keyboard interruptions won't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The API is presented in [AROMotorControlAPI.md](https://github.com/ediadvancedrobotics/hardwarelab/blob/main/README.md). The only methods that we need are `readPosition` and `applyTorqueToMotor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method has a `motorid` parameter, taking the value 1 or 2, which points to the motor that you wish to control.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to read the position (joint angle value) or a motor, simply call:\n",

    "## A torque controlled motor\n",
    "The motor is controlled by sending a current command to it, which results in its rotation. The rotational force produced is called a torque (more on this during the lectures).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Torque vs current\n",
    "This paragraph is just for general knowledge. The torque generated is proportional to the current through the relationship $\\tau = k I $, with $\\tau$ the torque, $I$ the current (in Amperes), and k a constant given by the manufacturer. In our case, the torque constant provided by the [manufacturer](https://www.myactuator.com/product-page/rmd-l-5010) is $0.16$, which trivially gives you $I = \\frac{\\tau}{0.16}$. We will trust the manufacturer although this might change from a motor to the other (and is yet another source of approximation).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sending a command\n",
    "To send current command you are required to use an exception handling mechanismthat always safely terminates by resetting the control command. Unfortunately this can't be encapsulated in a function as this results in packages loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `run_until` method defined there also allows you to call N times the same method while ensuring an accurate delay `dt` expires before being called again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us use `run_until` to send a constant torque of 0.02 Nm for 1 seconds\n",
